        >
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the
          landscape of control and estimation in complex dynamic systems
          especially in robotics and cyber-physical systems. This workshop aims
          to bring together researcher and practitioners at the intersection of
          control theory, artificial intelligence and robotics to explore
          generalized frameworks for control and estimation that are robust,
          scalable and adaptable to uncertain, high-dimensional and data-rich
          environment. Robotic systems with their nonlinear, high DOF dynamics
          and real-time interaction with unstructured environments provide a
          compelling platform for advancing and testing new-age methodologies.
          At the same time similar challenges arise across a wide range of
          complex systems - from unmanned autonomous vehicle and power system to
          biological networks and industrial processes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          This workshop will cover recent developments in both model based and
          data-driven approaches, including reinforcement learning, adaptive and
          robust control, observer design, distributed estimation, and hybris
          techniques that blend classical control with AI driven methods.
          Through invited talks, contributed presentations and panel
          discussions, the workshop will foster dialogue on open challenges,
          foundational principles, and future direction for control and
          estimation in the age of AI.
